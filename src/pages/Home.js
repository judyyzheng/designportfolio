              </div>
              <div className="">
                i'm currently a 4th year computer science and business administration student at the University of Waterloo,
                 specializing in artificial intelligence with a concentration in finance.  
              </div>
              <div className="">
                i started my tech journey late by today's standards, as i spent my high school/early uni years
                trying to intersect my passion for theoretical math, my interests in financial markets, and my desires for a creative outlet.
              </div>
              <div className="">
                lockdown frustrations kickstarted this journey, when i implemented my first python algorithm to optimize provincial
                 covid testing. 
              </div>
              <div className="">
                since then, i've dived into self-learning end-to-end software development, from figma design/prototyping (every image on this site is a custom vector) 
                to product management to fullstack api development. i got to develop my experiences at an array of fintech companies and banks, 
                and found a passion for financial accesibility and modernizing investment tools!
